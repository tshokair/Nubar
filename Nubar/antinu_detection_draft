\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Antineutrinos are identified in water Cherenkov detectors by the time correlated coincidence of the constituent particles in the inverse beta decay interaction.  In light water the coincidence is  two-fold between a prompt positron and a delayed neutron 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{\bar{\nu}+p\rightarrow e^++n}, 
\label{eq:ibdP}
\end{equation}
and in heavy water the coincidence is three-fold between the prompt positron and the two delayed neutrons 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{\bar{\nu}+d\rightarrow e^++n+n}.  
\label{eq:ibdD}
\end{equation}

In the case of reactor antineutrinos, geoneutrinos, or even hypothetical solar antineutrinos the energy spectrum of the prompt positron is different from the energy spectrum of the neutron. Previous antineutrino analyses in water Cherenkov relied on a single energy analysis threshold for all particles in the coincidence \cite{sno} \cite{SK}.  This analysis method exploits the different energy thresholds of the prompt and delayed particles to first search for the higher energy particle with one energy threshold and then "lookback" for the lower energy particle with a lower energy threshold. Data from the second phase of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) is used to search for antineutrinos and present a test case for this analysis method. 

\section{Energy Distributions}
\label{sec:en}
The SNO experiment was a heavy water Cherenkov experiment designed to study the $^{8}$B solar neutrinos.  The experiment consisted of a kiloton of heavy water surrounded by nearly 10,000 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and detected neutrinos via the charged current, neutral current, and elastic scattering of neutrinos on deuterium \cite{snoNIM}. In the second phase of the experiment, salt was added to the heavy water for neutron identification where neutrons capture on chlorine ($\mathrm{n+^{35}Cl\rightarrow \gamma +^{36}Cl}$)and emit a 8.6 MeV $\gamma$ cascade which Compton scatter and are detected by the PMTs. The energy spectrum from neutron simulations in the SNO detector is shown in Figure \ref{fig:neutronEn}.

In the inverse beta decay reaction, the positron carries the bulk of the antineutrino kinetic energy and is approximated as the antineutrino energy minus the threshold of the interaction. In the case of inverse beta decay on deuterium the positron energy is approximated as
\begin{equation}
E_{e^+}\approx E_{\bar{\nu}}-4.03\ \mathrm{MeV}.
\end{equation}
Simulating antineutrinos from a reactor spectrum gives the positron energies shown in Figure \ref{fig:posEn}.  The positron and neutron energy distributions are different and this difference can be exploited to search for these particles with different minimum analysis energy thresholds.  Specifically the positron spectrum extends lower than the neutron spectrum so using two thresholds allows for an increase in the overall acceptance of antineutrino coincidences compared to single threshold analyses while maintaing similar expected background contributions.  

\section{Accidental Coincidences}
\label{sec:bg} 
The backgrounds in antineutrino experiments will differ depending on the detector, but one background that is consistent among all detectors is accidental coincidences.  The rate of two- and three-fold accidental coincidences  particles are given by
\begin{equation}
r_{acc}(2-fold)=r_1r_2\Delta t
\label{eq:r2}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
r_{acc}(3-fold)=r_1r_2r_3\Delta t_{12}\Delta t_{23},
\label{eq:r3}
\end{equation}
where $r_i$ is the rate of a single event and $\Delta t_ij$ is the size of acceptance time-window between events in a coincidence.  The rate $r_i$ and thus the total rate of accidental coincidence $r_{acc}(n-fold)$ is directly related to the minimum energy threshold used to search for particle of type $i$. If the particles in the coincidence have different energy thresholds, then the rate of single events will be different for the different particles.  In the case of reactor antineutrinos at SNO, the positron visible energy is peaked at the minimum accepted value given the software trigger threshold of 3.2 MeV, while the visible neutron energy is peaked above 6 MeV as shown in Figure \ref{fig:visEn}, so applying a lower energy threshold for only the positrons will not reject many neutrons.  The two energy thresholds allows for acceptance of low energy positrons without the additional backgrounds from a low energy neutron search. 

In addition to the two energy thresholds, backgrounds can be reduced by utilized the time- and spatial-correlation of antineutrino events.  Figure \ref{fig:drdt} shows the capture time and length between prompt and delayed particles in an antineutrino coincidence. Since accidental coincidences are not spatially correlated, applying a distance cut corresponding to the neutron capture length in the medium will further reduce the accidental background.  

\section{Method}
\label{sec:intro} 
In water Cherenkov experiments neutrons are detected by their captures on protons, deuterons, chlorine, or gadolinium. In the case of deuterons, chlorine, and gadolinium the neutron capture cause the emission of $\gamma$s or $\gamma$ cascades, which are of energies between 6.25 and 8.6 MeV.  These visible neutron energies are peaked at higher values than positron energies from the inverse beta decay of reactor antineutrinos on either protons or deuterons. The high energy of the neutrons means that an energy threshold associated with a low single particle rate can be applied to neutron search without much neutron signal loss. 

This analysis method first searches for the neutron(s) and the looked back in time for find the lower energy positron.  In the specific case of the second phase of SNO an antineutrino can be identified by either a three-fold coincidence of the final particles in Equation \ref{eq:ivdd}, or a two-fold coincidence of either the positron and one of the neutrons or both neutrons.  The analysis code parsed through all events in data until an event above 4.5 MeV was found, this event is called the primary.  Once a primary was found, the code reset to back several events and then looked for events above 3.2 MeV that occurred within a time window (50 $\mu$s) of the primary, and continued parsing until several events after the primary. The multiplicity of the burst was then counted and events that were not two- or three-fold were rejected. The multiplicity two and three events were then subjected to a distance cut (200 cm) and coincidences were either accepted or rejected.
